The Love Boat soon will be making another run. The Love Boat promises something for everyone. Boy the way Glen Miller played. Songs that made the hit parade. Guys like us we had it made. Those were the days. Then one day he was shootin' at some food and up through the ground came a bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum. What might be right for you may not be right for some.
